It was my sophomore year which i got plenty of time to build projects and at the same time i was astonished with the importanace of image by watching a Ted talk on tuesday morning, that is when i thought to build a plaform for images.

# Serbim
Serbim is a social netowrking platform where you can upload any image on the planet if you are stuck with that. (Ex : New Product, Werid Images) , so that any user out there who has an idea on the similar image would like to answer, in the same way you can answer (or) read description of any image, so that the user who writes more gets star rating and will be awarded as a top writer.
