# Preface
It was my sophomore year in which i got plenty of time to build projects and at the same time i was astonished with the importanace of images by watching a Ted talk on tuesday morning, that is when i thought to build a plaform for images.

# Serbim Description
Serbim is a social netowrking platform where you can upload any image on the planet if you are stuck with it. (Ex : New Product, Weird Images etc..) , so that any user out there who has an idea on that image would like to answer, in the same way you can answer (or) read answers of any image, so that the user who writes more gets star rating and will be awarded as a top writer.
The more you write, the more you are recognized.

It was build on languages such as HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, SQL.

# Accessing
To acess this you need to have similar names in the local database with respect to names in the image files when you entering a input.
